## What is Collections?

Collections is a visual organizer app that aims to be convenient and easy to use.

Our target userbase is hobbyist collectors who would like a way to organize and look through their collections in a way that allows them to get all of the information they need without having to search through their physical collections.

There are many tools that collectors use to catalog their collections, but none of them are built specifically for collectors.

Other names considered were cshelf and CVO.

## Product Vision Statement

For collectors who need an easy and convenient way to organize their collection, Collections is a visual organizer that provides a simple and visual way to organize collections. Unlike spreadsheets, which are wordy and complicated, our product solves this issue by visually organizing your items to your liking.
