			<h3>Selling Cards</h3>
			<p>Bobby is talking about some of his baseball cards at lunch, and somebody has expressed interest in buying one of his cards! Upon hearing this, he opens Collections to check the value of the card and proposes a price. After a bit of negotiation, they both agree on a price. Money is exchanged, and Bobby marks the card as sold. He enters the sale price of the card, and it is moved to the “Sold” page of his collection.</p>
