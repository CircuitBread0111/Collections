			<h3>Germany</h3>
			<p>John was called for a construction project in Germany where he was introduced to their currency. He soon realized that his collection only contained rare United States currency only.</p>
			<p>John began research into rare coins from across the country and found a new expansion to his hobby that he had never realized before, so he began buying and searching for rare coins from different periods and countries. This brought the idea of a new way to organize the coins that wasnâ€™t just by year alone.</p>
			<p>John used collections to add tags to the items so they appear in more than one collection at a time. This saved him tons of time in searching for a coin he may have already ordered or sold.</p>
