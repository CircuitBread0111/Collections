			<h3>Game Store</h3>
			<p>James has fall break and has decided to return home for a couple of days. Back home, there is a store that he likes to get games from: Bob’s Used Game Store. Every time he returns home, he makes a trip to Bob’s store to check if they have anything he has been looking for, since he has pretty good luck there.</p>
			<p>James uses Collections to keep a list of games he is actively looking for. When he enters the store, he goes up to the counter and asks the cashier to look up the inventory status of a couple games. Upon seeing that a couple games are in stock, he buys them, and marks them as obtained in Collections. The entries are moved out of his wishlist, and into his collection.</p>
			<p>Later, after he returns home, he goes onto the computer to add details about his specific copy of each of the games.</p>
