			<p>James is going on an airplane trip soon, and he wants to bring his Game Boy. While packing, he grabs Pokemon Yellow and decides to test it. Unfortunately, when he boots it up, he notices that his save data is gone! Since Collections provides every entry with a UID, he prints them out and sticks them to his cartridges and disc cases, so he doesnâ€™t have to scroll through his collection every time he wants to reference something. He quickly looks up the UID for his cartridge and notes that the save battery is dead.</p>
