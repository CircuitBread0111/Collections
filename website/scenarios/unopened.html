			<h3>Unopened</h3>
			<p>Don was looking through his Hot Wheels collection and realized that unopened cars have higher value than cars that are out of the box. Out of curiosity he compared the prices and was amazed by the massive change in value for in-box models.</p>
			<p>Don wanted to see which of them were still in-box and mark them as special in his collection. So Don used a tag feature in Collections to mark which ones were still in box and from that was able to organize a new category where he organized them by condition of item.</p>
