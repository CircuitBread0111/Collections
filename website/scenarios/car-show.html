			<h3>Car Show</h3>
			<p>Don went to his town’s annual car show and decided to bring his own classic car into the show. This year had a massive turn out and he found stands where people were selling rare vintage Hot Wheels cars. This surprised him since he collected his Hot Wheels slowly and overtime since he was not a big fan of using the internet to buy them.</p>
			<p>Don asked the vendor how he was able to manage to keep track of the value of all these cars and he recommended that Don look at Collections. He was unsure at first since it was online but found its interface easy to use and even added his own collection to the site and looked up other people’s collections to compare his to others.</p>
