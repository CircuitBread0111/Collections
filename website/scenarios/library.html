			<h3>Library</h3>
			<p>Emily bought an auction for an abandoned library in hopes to find new books for her collection. She though it would be a fun idea to make a field trip to the library with her class to find interesting books they may come across to learn about them.</p>
			<p>Emily soon realized she didnâ€™t want the student to use any books she owns or any they read during the school year. This gave her the idea to share her library though Collections so that the students can have access to what she has and even ask to barrow any books they may want to read.</p>
