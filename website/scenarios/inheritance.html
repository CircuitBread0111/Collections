			<h3>Inheritance</h3>
			<p>John got a call during a routine inspection that his mother had left him something in her will. He inherited a gift from his mother which was her coin collection. This made John happy since this is what inspired him to go into coin collection to begin with.</p>
			<p>While going through the collection, he realized how large the collection is compared to his own and that a new organizational method was needed. John wanted to distinguish the coins that he has vs the ones he doesnâ€™t, to possibly resell them or save them for later.</p>
			<p>After going through many of the coins, he uses Collections to create a separate additional collection within his collection for the coins he was left so he can compare them to his own. Which save John tons of time in organizing the collection.</p>
