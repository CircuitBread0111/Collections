			<h3>School</h3>
			<p>Bobby likes to use the school computers to look up the value of rare baseball cards instead of doing schoolwork. While he is doing this, he also looks at his own collection. Since Collections is a web application, he can log into it and view his collections from the school computers. As he is looking at cards, he adds them to his wishlist.</p>
			<p>Later at baseball practice, he pulls up his wishlist to show his teammates at school all the baseball cards he is looking for.</p>
