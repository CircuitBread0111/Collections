			<h3>Shop</h3>
			<p>While Don was working late in his shop, he was approached by one of his employees who knew that he collected Hot Wheels. The employee told Don about old Hot Wheels toys he had as a kid that he found when cleaning his storage.</p>
			<p>Don was surprised by the large size of the collection and was overwhelmed trying to organize them, so they didn’t get mixed with his collector’s sets. He soon remembered that Collections has a feature to create collections within collections to make categories to separate them, while keeping them under one Hot Wheels collection.</p>
