			<h3>Minting Error</h3>
			<p>John recently got a raise at his construction job and took the opportunity to increase his budget for buying rare coins. He recently been looking into coins with minting errors since their value is much greater than the standard issue of the coin.</p>
			<p>While surfing the web, John checks places like eBay to place bids on any coins he wants for his collection. Out of curiosity he looks up the type of minting error to see if any of the coins he has collected have any errors.</p>
			<p>John decides to go through his collection to see if any of coins had minting error. He had to go through each coin to find which issues had known errors. It was tedious, but he was able to find a well-known error in his collection and plans to organize them in their own container.</p>
			<p>He soon realizes that the tedious effort of going through to check each coin one at a time to check is not a great way to find and organize errors. John uses Collections to organize his collection and search categories by year of mint so he can check if he owns the coin. From this he removes the need to search if the coin is not in the collection.</p>
