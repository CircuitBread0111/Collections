			<h3>Yard Sales</h3>
			<p>It is yard sale season, and James is looking to expand his retro game collection by looking for them at yard sales. However, since yard sales are so unpredictable, he does not have a list of specific games he is looking for.</p>
			<p>After driving around for 20 minutes, James finally finds an unlicensed copy of Tetris for the NES. Since this is an unlicensed cartridge, it is much harder to find than the later licensed release, so he is inclined to grab it. However, he does not remember whether he already has it. James quickly pulls out his phone and performs a quick search of his NES collection to see whether he has the game. Upon seeing that there are no results, he buys the game.</p>
			<p>James hops back into the car, takes a picture of the cartridge, and adds it to his collection. Next time he sees the game, he can quickly look to see that he already has it and decide whether he wants another copy.</p>
