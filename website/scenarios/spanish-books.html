			<h3>Spanish Books</h3>
			<p>Emily has been teaching her students Spanish this Fall and wants to find ways to bring more literature into her class. While talking to the other teachers they suggest finding books that are more well known, but in Spanish rather than English and even recommended some books to use.</p>
			<p>At home, Emily went through her collection of novels and short stories to find books that she was recommended to see if she has read it before to compare it to a Spanish version. While struggling to find the book, she remembers cataloging her books in Collections and was able to search up the book where she made a note of its location in her library.</p>
