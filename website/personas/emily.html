			<h3>Emily</h3>
			<p>Emily, age 24 is a language teacher for her local university in Texas. She was born in Florida where her mother is an English teacher; so, from an early age she loved to read. After graduating with a degree in Foreign Language Emily went off to teach children other languages from around the world. Where in her free time she buys and reads books from other countries.</p>
			<p>Emily likes using e-books as they save space and are easy to use, though struggles with the digital library compared to her own at home. Emily keeps her books organized and alphabetized, but her ever-growing collection is difficult to keep track of when the Dewey Decimal system it not keen on books overseas. Emily could use Collections to keep track of both her physical books and digital books to organize her collection and even show examples to her class.</p>
