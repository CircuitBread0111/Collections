			<h3>Bobby</h3>
			<p>Bobby, age 15, is a high school student in his town. He was born in Kansas where both of his parents took care of him. Bobby played baseball from an early age and competes competitively in his baseball team at school. In his free time, he watches the MLB and collects baseball cards of his favorite players. He spends most of his allowance on cards in hopes it will collect value one day.</p>
			<p>Bobby plays video games and uses his computer in school where he looks up the current value of rare baseball cards. However, he realized he doesnâ€™t know how to organize his cards by value in an easy way. He attempts to write them down, but the number of cards is too much. Collections would be helpful in categorizing the rare cards from the standard cards in his collection.</p>
