			<h3>Don</h3>
			<p>Don, age 65, is a retired mechanic who ran his own repair shop. He was born in Kentucky where he spent most of his early age playing hot wheels. After passing his mechanics exam he opened his own shop where he repairs and fixes classic cars. This inspired him to take his family to car shows where he showed off his classic car that won awards and recognition.</p>
			<p>Don in his retired free time, chooses to collect old hot wheel cars which provide an interest to his work in cars. Although not playing with them, he struggles to use his computer to find out the value of his collection and how to keep track of the series he collected throughout the years. Collections would provide a way to organize and group the sets in his hot wheels collection.</p>
