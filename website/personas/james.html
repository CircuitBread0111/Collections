			<h3>James</h3>
			<p>James, age 20, is a college student for Ohio State University. He was born in Ohio where both his parents worked as engineers. James is working for his electrical engineering degree where is hope to work in the field of electronics development. James spends most of his time studying for classes, but in his down time like to play retro video games. He goes to yard sales and small games stores to expand his list of games and consoles to play.</p>
			<p>James is highly fluent in technology and understands how to work and use them as a tool for his needs. He likes to keep his games organized by the console to keep track of his collection. However, when out shopping James tends to forget which games he already owns and buys a second copy as mistake at times. Collections would help organize this collection to know what he does and does not have in his collection.</p>
