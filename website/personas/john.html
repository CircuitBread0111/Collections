			<h3>John</h3>
			<p>John, age 55, is an operations manager for a construction company in California. He was born in Virginia where his father worked as a tool smith and his mother was a stay at home wife. After gaining his contracting license he moved to California to work on big construction projects. On his off days he likes to go online shopping for old coins. Johnâ€™s mother collected rare coins as a hobby which inspired him to do the same where he found its history interesting.</p>
			<p>John uses his computer regularly to shop, pay bills and surf the web. He is no expert on computers, but understands them and uses computers regularly. John dislikes being unorganized and keeps everything clean and in a place at home. However John is frustrated about his large and growing collection of old coins. Collection might be something John uses to help organize this large collection.</p>
